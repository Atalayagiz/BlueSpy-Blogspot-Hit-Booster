# BlueSpy-Blogspot-Hit-Booster

This application is published for educational purposes only.

How to:
First of all, you must enter the values you will enter in seconds. E.g;

time 1 = 10
time 2 = 15

When you enter the application, it goes to your blog 10 seconds after the application is opened, waits for 15 seconds on your blog and goes into standby mode. After 10 seconds it will hit your blog again.

In debug mode, the application is not added to startup. You can open it on your own computer and test it. In the other mode, the application copies itself to the startup and runs again every time the computer is turned on.

Reminding!
This system can damage your ads on your blog. If you have an ad, think twice before using it. Of course, if you set the time properly, you can even earn money on the contrary :D.
